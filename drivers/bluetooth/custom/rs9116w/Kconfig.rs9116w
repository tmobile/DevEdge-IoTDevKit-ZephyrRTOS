config BT_WHITELIST
	  bool "Whitelist support"
	  help
	  This option enables the whitelist API. This takes advantage of the
	  whitelisting feature of a BLE controller.
	  The whitelist is a global list and the same whitelist is used
	  by both scanner and advertiser. The whitelist cannot be modified while
	  it is in use.

	  An Advertiser can whitelist which peers can connect or request scan
	  response data.
	  A scanner can whitelist advertiser for which it will generate
	  advertising reports.
	  Connections can be established automatically for whitelisted peers.

	  This options deprecates the bt_le_set_auto_conn API in favor of the
	  bt_conn_create_aute_le API.

config BT_DEVICE_NAME_DYNAMIC
	bool "Allow to set Bluetooth device name on runtime"
	help
	  Enabling this option allows for runtime configuration of Bluetooth
	  device name.

config BT_DEVICE_NAME_MAX
	int "Maximum size in bytes for device name"
	depends on BT_DEVICE_NAME_DYNAMIC
	default 28
	range 2 248

	  Bluetooth device name storage size. Storage can be up to 248 bytes
	  long (excluding NULL termination).

config BT_DEVICE_NAME
	string "Bluetooth device name"
	default "Zephyr"
	help
	  Bluetooth device name. Name can be up to 248 bytes long (excluding

config BT_CONN_PARAM_UPDATE_TIMEOUT
	int "Peripheral connection parameter update timeout in milliseconds"

	range 0 65535

	help
	  The value is a timeout used by peripheral device to wait until it
	  starts the first connection parameters update procedure after a
	  connection has been established.
	  The connection parameters requested will be the parameters set by the
	  application, or the peripheral preferred connection parameters if
	  configured.
	  The default value is set to 5 seconds, to comply with the Bluetooth
	  Core specification: Core 4.2 Vol 3, Part C, 9.3.12.2:
	  "The Peripheral device should not perform a Connection Parameter
	  Update procedure within 5 seconds after establishing a connection."

config BT_ATT_PREPARE_COUNT
	int "Number of ATT prepare write buffers"
	default 0
	range 0 64
	help
	  Number of buffers available for ATT prepare write, setting
	  this to 0 disables GATT long/reliable writes.

config RSI_BT_EVENT_QUEUE_SIZE

config BT_BONDABLE
	bool "Bondable Mode"
	default y
	help
	  This option enables support for Bondable Mode. In this mode,
	  Bonding flag in AuthReq of SMP Pairing Request/Response will be set
	  indicating the support for this mode.

config BT_ENFORCE_MITM
	bool "Enforce MITM protection"
	default y
	help
	  With this option enabled, the Security Manager will set MITM option in
	  the Authentication Requirements Flags whenever local IO Capabilities
	  allow the generated key to be authenticated.

# config BT_FIXED_PASSKEY
# 	bool "Use a fixed passkey for pairing"
# 	help
# 	  With this option enabled, the application will be able to call the
# 	  bt_passkey_set() API to set a fixed passkey. If set, the
# 	  pairing_confim() callback will be called for all incoming pairings.

config BT_SMP_SC_PAIR_ONLY
	bool "Disable legacy pairing"
	help
	  This option disables LE legacy pairing and forces LE secure connection
	  pairing. All Security Mode 1 levels can be used with legacy pairing
	  disabled, but pairing with devices that do not support secure
	  connections pairing will not be supported.
	  To force a higher security level use "Secure Connections Only Mode"
