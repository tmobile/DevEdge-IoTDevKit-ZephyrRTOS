      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The TX pin to use.

      For pins P0.0 through P0.31, use the pin number. For example,
      to use P0.16 for TX, set:

        tx-pin = <16>;

      For pins P1.0 through P1.31, add 32 to the pin number. For
      example, to use P1.2 for TX, set:

        tx-pin = <34>;  /* 32 + 2 */

  rx-pin:

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The RX pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
      tx-pin property's.

  rts-pin:
    type: int
    deprecated: true
    description: |
      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver
      is not enabled.

      The RTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
      tx-pin property's.

  cts-pin:
    type: int
    deprecated: true

      IMPORTANT: This option will only be used if the new pin control driver

      The CTS pin to use. The pin numbering scheme is the same as the
      tx-pin property's.

      Enable pull-up resistor on the RX pin.

  cts-pull-up:
