  input-src:
    description: |
      Connects the UART receive line (USIC DX0 input) to a specific GPIO pin.
      The USIC DX0 input is a multiplexer which connects to different GPIO pins.
      Refer to the XMC4XXX reference manual for the GPIO pin/mux mappings. DX0G
      is the loopback input line.

  fifo-start-offset:
    description: |
      Each USIC0..2 has a fifo that is shared between two channels. For example,
      usic0ch0 and usic0ch1 will share the same fifo. This parameter defines an offset
      where the tx and rx fifos will start. When sharing the fifo, the user must properly
      define the offset based on the configuration of the other channel. The fifo has a
      capacity of 64 entries. The tx/rx fifos are created on fifo-xx-size aligned
      boundaries.

    required: true
    type: int

  fifo-tx-size:
    description: |
      Fifo size used for buffering transmit bytes. A value of 0 implies that
      the fifo is not used while transmitting.
    required: true
    type: int
    enum:
      - 0
      - 2

      - 64

  fifo-rx-size:
    description: |
      Fifo size used for buffering received bytes. A value of 0 implies that
      the fifo is not used while receiving.
    required: true
    type: int

      - 0

  interrupts:
    description: |
      IRQ number and priority to use for interrupt driven UART.
      USIC0..2 have their own interrupt range as follows:
      USIC0 = [84, 89]
      USIC1 = [90, 95]
      USIC2 = [96, 101]
