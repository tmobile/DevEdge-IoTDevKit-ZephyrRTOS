  Zephyr MMC disk node. A binding with this compatible present within an SD
  host controller device node indicates that an MMC chip is attached to that
  SD bus. This binding will enable that to be used with the disk driver
  API and any subsystems that utilize it.

compatible: "zephyr,mmc-disk"

include: [sd-device.yaml]
