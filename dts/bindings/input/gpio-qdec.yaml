  GPIO based QDEC input device

  Implement an input device generating relative axis event reports for a rotary
  encoder connected to two GPIOs. The driver is normally idling until it sees a
  transition on any of the encoder signal lines, then switches to polling mode
  and samples the two signal lines periodically to track the encoder position,
  and goes back to idling after the specified timeout.

  Example configuration:

  #include <dt-bindings/input/input-event-codes.h>

  qdec {
          compatible = "gpio-qdec";
          gpios = <&gpio0 14 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH)>,
                  <&gpio0 13 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH)>;
          steps-per-period = <4>;
          zephyr,axis = <INPUT_REL_Y>;
          sample-time-us = <2000>;
          idle-timeout-ms = <200>;
  };

compatible: "gpio-qdec"

include: base.yaml
