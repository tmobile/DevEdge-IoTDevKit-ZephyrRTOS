    Bluetooth module that uses Zephyr's Bluetooth Host Controller Interface SPI
    driver (e.g. nRF51822)

compatible: "zephyr,bt-hci-spi"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  irq-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

  reset-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true

  reset-assert-duration-ms:
    type: int
    description:
      Minimum duration to hold the reset-gpios pin low for.
      If not specified no delay beyond the code path execution time is guaranteed.

  controller-data-delay-us:
    type: int
    default: 20
    description:
      Duration to delay between reading a valid header and reading the data associated
      with that header. This delay gives the controller time to configure the SPI data
      transaction after finishing the header transaction. Without this delay the host
      can attempt to read before the controller is ready, resulting in empty data that
      then needs to be read a second time. The default of 20uS was chosen as the lowest
      delay that reliably eliminated double transmits between a nRF9160 host and a
      nRF52832 controller.
