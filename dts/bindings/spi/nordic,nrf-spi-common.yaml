properties:
  reg:
    required: true

  interrupts:
    required: true

  pinctrl-0:
    required: true

  max-frequency:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum data rate the SPI peripheral can be driven at, in Hz. This
      property must be set at SoC level DTS files.

  overrun-character:
    type: int
    default: 0xff
    description: |
      The overrun character (ORC) is used when all bytes from the TX buffer
      are sent, but the transfer continues due to RX. Defaults to 0xff
      (line high), the most common value used in SPI transfers.

  easydma-maxcnt-bits:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: |
      Maximum number of bits available in the EasyDMA MAXCNT register. This
      property must be set at SoC level DTS files.
