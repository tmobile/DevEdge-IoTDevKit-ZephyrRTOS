      Connects the I2C clock line (USIC DX0 input) to a specific GPIO pin.
      The USIC DX0 input is a multiplexer which connects to different GPIO pins.
      Refer to the XMC4XXX reference manual for the GPIO pin/mux mappings.

      IRQ number and priority to use for interrupt driven by I2C.
      Each USIC must use a certain interrupt range:
      USIC0 = [84, 89]
      USIC1 = [90, 95]
      USIC2 = [96, 101]

  pinctrl-0:
    description: |
      PORT pin configuration for SCL, SDA signals.
      We expect that the phandles will reference pinctrl nodes. These
      nodes will have a nodelabel that matches the Infineon SoC Pinctrl
      defines and have following
      format: <signal>_p<port>_<pin>_<peripheral inst>

      Examples:
        pinctrl-0 = <&i2c_scl_p5_2_u2c0 &i2c_sda_p5_0_u2c0>;
