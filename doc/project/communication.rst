Communication and Collaboration
###############################

The `Zephyr Discord Server <https://chat.zephyrproject.org>`_ is the primary
chat forum used by Zephyr developers, contributors, and users.

The `Zephyr project mailing lists
<https://lists.zephyrproject.org/g/main/subgroups>`_ are used as an additional
communication tool by project members, contributors, and the community. There
are specialized mailing lists for specific interests. Several lists are public
and open. Mailing lists are always available for use in situations where
Discord is unavailable or an unsuitable forum.

In general, bug reports and other issues should be reported as `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues>`_ and not broadcasted to
the mailing list. The same applies to code reviews.
