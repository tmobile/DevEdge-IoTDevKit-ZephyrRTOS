Changes in this release
=======================

* Any applications using the mcuboot image manager
  (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMG_MANAGER`) will now need to also select
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_MAP` and :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STREAM_FLASH`,
  this prevents a cmake dependency loop if the image manager Kconfig is enabled
  manually without also manually enabling the other options.

* Including hawkbit in an application now requires additional Kconfig options
  to be selected, previously these options would have been selected
  automatically but have changed from ``select`` options in Kconfig files to
  ``depends on``:

   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NVS`                     |
   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH`                   |

   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT`      |
   +--------------------------------------------------+

* Including updatehub in an application now requires additional Kconfig options
  to be selected, previously these options would have been selected
  automatically but have changed from ``select`` options in Kconfig files to
  ``depends on``:

   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH`                   |
   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STREAM_FLASH`            |

   +--------------------------------------------------+
   | :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HWINFO`                  |
   +--------------------------------------------------+

* The sensor driver API clarified :c:func:`sensor_trigger_set` to state that
  the user-allocated sensor trigger will be stored by the driver as a pointer,
  rather than a copy, and passed back to the handler. This enables the handler
  to use :c:macro:`CONTAINER_OF` to retrieve a context pointer when the trigger
  is embedded in a larger struct and requires that the trigger is not allocated
  on the stack. Applications that allocate a sensor trigger on the stack need
  to be updated.

* Converted few drivers to the :ref:`input` subsystem.

  * ``gpio_keys``: moved out of ``gpio``, replaced the custom API to use input
    events instead, the :dtcompatible:`zephyr,gpio-keys` binding is unchanged
    but now requires ``zephyr,code`` to be set.
  * ``ft5336``: moved from :ref:`kscan_api` to :ref:`input`, renamed the Kconfig
    options from ``CONFIG_KSCAN_FT5336``, ``CONFIG_KSCAN_FT5336_PERIOD`` and
    ``KSCAN_FT5336_INTERRUPT`` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT_FT5336`,
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT_FT5336_PERIOD` and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT_FT5336_INTERRUPT`.
  * ``kscan_sdl``: moved from :ref:`kscan_api` to :ref:`input`, renamed the Kconfig
    option from ``KSCAN_SDL`` to :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_INPUT_SDL_TOUCH` and the
    compatible from ``zephyr,sdl-kscan`` to
    :dtcompatible:`zephyr,input-sdl-touch`.
  * Touchscreen drivers converted to use the input APIs can use the
    :dtcompatible:`zephyr,kscan-input` driver to maintain Kscan compatilibity.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Configuring applications with ``prj_<board>.conf`` files has been deprecated,
  this should be replaced by using a prj.conf with the common configuration and
  board-specific configuration in board Kconfig fragments in the ``boards``
  folder of the application.

Stable API changes in this release
==================================

* Removed `bt_set_oob_data_flag` and replaced it with two new API calls:
  * :c:func:`bt_le_oob_set_sc_flag` for setting/clearing OOB flag in SC pairing
  * :c:func:`bt_le_oob_set_legacy_flag` for setting/clearing OOB flag in legacy paring

New APIs in this release
========================

* Introduced :c:func:`flash_ex_op` function. This allows to perform extra
  operations on flash devices, defined by Zephyr Flash API or by vendor specific
  header files. Support for extra operations is enabled by
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_EX_OP_ENABLED` which depends on
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_HAS_EX_OP` selected by driver.

Build system and infrastructure
*******************************

* Fixed an issue whereby older versions of the Zephyr SDK toolchain were used
  instead of the latest compatible version.

* Fixed an issue whereby building an application with sysbuild and specifying
  mcuboot's verification to be checksum only did not build a bootable image.

* Fixed an issue whereby if no prj.conf file was present then board
  configuration files would not be included by emitting a fatal error. As a
  result, prj.conf files are now mandatory in projects.

* Introduced support for extending/replacing the signing mechanism in zephyr,
  see :ref:`West extending signing <west-extending-signing>` for further
  details.

Drivers and Sensors
*******************

* ADC

 * MCUX LPADC driver now uses the channel parameter to select a software channel
   configuration buffer. Use ``zephyr,input-positive`` and
   ``zephyr,input-negative`` devicetree properties to select the hardware
   channel(s) to link a software channel configuration to.

* Battery-backed RAM

  * Added MCP7940N battery-backed RTC SRAM driver.

* CAN

* Clock control

* Counter

* Crypto

* DAC

* DFU

* Disk

* Display

* DMA

* EEPROM

  * Switched from :dtcompatible:`atmel,at24` to dedicated :dtcompatible:`zephyr,i2c-target-eeprom` for I2C EEPROM target driver.

* Entropy

* ESPI

* Ethernet

* Flash

  * Introduced new flash API call :c:func:`flash_ex_op` which calls
    :c:func:`ec_op` callback provided by a flash driver. This allows to perform
    extra operations on flash devices, defined by Zephyr Flash API or by vendor
    specific header files. :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_HAS_EX_OP` should be
    selected by the driver to indicate that extra operations are supported.
    To enable extra operations user should select
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FLASH_EX_OP_ENABLED`.

* FPGA

* Fuel Gauge

* GPIO

  * Converted the ``gpio_keys`` driver to the input subsystem.

* hwinfo

* I2C

* I2S

* I3C

* IEEE 802.15.4

* Input

  * Introduced the :ref:`input` subsystem.

* Interrupt Controller

* IPM

* KSCAN

  * Added a :dtcompatible:`zephyr,kscan-input` input to kscan compatibility driver.
  * Converted the ``ft5336`` and ``kscan_sdl`` drivers to the input subsystem.

* LED

* MBOX

* MEMC

* PCIE

* PECI

* Retained memory

  * Retained memory (retained_mem) driver has been added with backends for
    Nordic nRF GPREGRET, and uninitialised RAM.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* File systems

  * Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FS_FATFS_REENTRANT` to enable the FAT FS reentrant option.
  * With LittleFS as backend, :c:func:`fs_mount` return code was corrected to ``EFAULT`` when
    called with ``FS_MOUNT_FLAG_NO_FORMAT`` and the designated LittleFS area could not be
    mounted because it has not yet been mounted or it required reformatting.

* Management

  * Added optional input expiration to shell MCUmgr transport, this allows
    returning the shell to normal operation if a complete MCUmgr packet is not
    received in a specific duration. Can be enabled with
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_SHELL_INPUT_TIMEOUT` and timeout
    set with
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_SHELL_INPUT_TIMEOUT_TIME`.

  * MCUmgr fs_mgmt upload and download now caches the file handle to improve
    throughput when transferring data, the file is no longer opened and closed
    for each part of a transfer. In addition, new functionality has been added
    that will allow closing file handles of uploaded/downloaded files if they
    are idle for a period of time, the timeout is set with
    :kconfig:option:`MCUMGR_GRP_FS_FILE_AUTOMATIC_IDLE_CLOSE_TIME`. There is a
    new command that can be used to close open file handles which can be used
    after a file upload is complete to ensure that the file handle is closed
    correctly, allowing other transports or other parts of the application
    code to use it.

* RTIO

  * Added policy that every ``sqe`` will generate a ``cqe`` (previously an RTIO_SQE_TRANSACTION
    entry would only trigger a ``cqe`` on the last ``sqe`` in the transaction.

HALs

MCUboot
*******

* Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUBOOT_CMAKE_WEST_SIGN_PARAMS` that allows to pass arguments to
  west sign when invoked from cmake.
