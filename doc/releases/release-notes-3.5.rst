API Changes
***********

Changes in this release
=======================

* Set :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SRAM_SIZE` default value to ``0`` (was
  ``16``). Bootloaders that use a part of the SRAM should set this value to an
  appropriate size. :github:`60371`

Removed APIs in this release
============================

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Setting the GIC architecture version by selecting
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GIC_V1`, :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GIC_V2` and
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_GIC_V3` directly in Kconfig has been deprecated.
  The GIC version should now be specified by adding the appropriate compatible, for
  example :dtcompatible:`arm,gic-v2`, to the GIC node in the device tree.
