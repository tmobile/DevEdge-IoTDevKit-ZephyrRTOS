/**
 * @file
 * @brief Real-time clock control based on the gecko counter API.
 *
 * The Gecko Real Time Counter and Calendar (RTCC) is a 32-bit
 * counter ensuring timekeeping in low energy modes. The RTCC
 * also includes a calendar mode for easy time and date keeping.
 *
 * The core Zephyr API to this device is as a counter, with the
 * following limitations:
 * * many other counter APIs, such as start/stop/set_top_value are not
 *   supported as the clock is always running.
 * * the RTCC has three different Capture/Compare channels which can
 *   trigger wake-up, generate PRS signalling, or capture system events.
 *
 * Most applications for this device will need to use the extended
 * functionality exposed by this header to access the real-time-clock
 * features.
