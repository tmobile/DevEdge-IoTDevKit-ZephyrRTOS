# CODEOWNERS for autoreview assigning in github

# https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners#codeowners-syntax

# Order is important; for each modified file, the last matching
# pattern takes the most precedence.
# That is, with the last pattern being
# *.rst                                     @nashif
# if only .rst files are being modified, only nashif is
# automatically requested for review, but you can manually
# add others as needed.

# Do not use wildcard on all source yet
# *                                        @galak @nashif
