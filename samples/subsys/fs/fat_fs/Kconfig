	  In case when no files could be listed, because there are none,
	  "some.dir" directory and "other.txt" file will be created
	  and list will run again to show them. This is useful when
	  showing how FAT works on non-SD devices like internal flash
	  or (Q)SPI connected memories, where it is not possible to
	  easily add files with use of other device.
