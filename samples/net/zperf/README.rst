zperf is board-agnostic. However, to run the zperf sample application,
the target platform must provide a network interface supported by Zephyr.

This sample application has been tested on the following platforms:

- Freedom Board (FRDM K64F)
- QEMU x86
- Arm FVP BaseR AEMv8-R
- ARM BASE RevC AEMv8A Fixed Virtual Platforms

Depending on the network technology chosen, extra steps may be required
to setup the network environment.

*****

See :ref:`zperf library documentation <zperf>` for more information about
the library usage.
